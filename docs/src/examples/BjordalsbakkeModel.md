# A simple single-chamber model

![Single chamber, closed-loop, lumped parameter model of the systemic circulation and the left ventricle. The circuit equivalent formulation of the model is depicted, with the pressures of each compartment, as well as most of the mechanical parameters. The model describes three compartments: the left ventricular, arterial and venous compartments. 𝑃𝑡ℎ is the intrathoracic pressure, 𝑃𝑙𝑣 is the left ventricular pressure and 𝐸𝑙𝑣(𝑡) indicates the left ventricular elastance function.](./BjordalsbakkeModelSketch.png)

Changes from the published version above:

- Capacitors are replaced by compliances. These are identical to capacitors, but have an additional parameter, the unstrained volume $V_0$, which allows for realistic blood volume modelling.
  Compliances have an inlet and an oulet in line with the flow, rather than the ground connector of the dangling capacitor.
- The aortic resistor is combined with the valve (diode) in the `ResistorDiode` element.

n2LV    = 21.9;
Tau1fLV = 0.303 * τ;

## Calculating the additional `k` parameter

The ventricle elastance is modelled as:

$$E_{l v}(t)=\left(E_{\max }-E_{\min }\right) e(t)+E_{\min }$$

where $e$ is a double-Hill function, i.e., two Hill-functions, which are multiplied by each other:

$$e(\tau)= k \times \frac{\left(\tau / \tau_1\right)^{n_1}}{1+\left(\tau / \tau_1\right)^{n_1}} \times \frac{1}{1+\left(\tau / \tau_2\right)^{n_2}}$$

and $k$ is a scaling factor to assure that $e(t)$ has a maximum of $e(t)_{max} = 1$:

$$k = \max \left(\frac{\left(\tau / \tau_1\right)^{n_1}}{1+\left(\tau / \tau_1\right)^{n_1}} \times \frac{1}{1+\left(\tau / \tau_2\right)^{n_2}} \right)^{-1}$$

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
nstep = 1000
t = LinRange(0, τ, nstep)

kLV = 1 / maximum((t ./ Tau1fLV).^n1LV ./ (1 .+ (t ./ Tau1fLV).^n1LV) .* 1 ./ (1 .+ (t ./ Tau2fLV).^n2LV))
````

## Set up the model elements

Set up time as a variable `t`

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
@variables t
````

Heart is modelled as a single chamber (we call it `LV` for "Left Ventricle" so the model can be extended later, if required):

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
@named LV = DHChamber(V₀ = 0.0, Eₘₐₓ=Eₘₐₓ, Eₘᵢₙ=Eₘᵢₙ, n₁=n1LV, n₂=n2LV, τ = τ, τ₁=Tau1fLV, τ₂=Tau2fLV, k = kLV, Eshift=0.0)
````

The two valves are simple diodes with a small resistance
(resistance is needed, since perfect diodes would connect two elastances/compliances, which will lead to unstable oscillations):

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
@named AV = ResistorDiode(R=Zao)
@named MV = ResistorDiode(R=Rmv)
````

The main components of the circuit are 1 resistor `Rs` and two compliances for systemic arteries `Csa`,
and systemic veins `Csv` (names are arbitrary).
_Note: one of the compliances is defined in terms of $dV/dt$ using the option `inV = true`. The other
without that option is in $dp/dt$._

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
@named Rs = Resistor(R=R_s)

@named Csa = Compliance(C=C_sa)
@named Csv = Compliance(C=C_sv, inP=true)
````

## Build the system

### Connections

The system is built using the `connect` function. `connect` sets up the Kirchhoff laws:

- pressures are the same in all connected branches on a connector
- sum of all flow rates at a connector is zero

The resulting set of Kirchhoff equations is stored in `circ_eqs`:

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
circ_eqs = [
    connect(LV.out, AV.in)
    connect(AV.out, Csa.in)
    connect(Csa.out, Rs.in)
    connect(Rs.out, Csv.in)
    connect(Csv.out, MV.in)
    connect(MV.out, LV.in)
]
````

### Add the component equations

In a second step, the system of Kirchhoff equations is completed by the component equations (both ODEs and AEs), resulting in the full, overdefined ODE set `circ_model`.

_Note: we do this in two steps._

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
@named _circ_model = ODESystem(circ_eqs, t)

@named circ_model = compose(_circ_model,
                          [LV, AV, MV, Rs, Csa, Csv])
````

### Simplify the ODE system

The crucial step in any acausal modelling is the sympification and reduction of the OD(A)E system to the minimal set of equations. ModelingToolkit.jl does this in the `structural_simplify` function.

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
circ_sys = structural_simplify(circ_model)
````

`circ_sys` is now the minimal system of equations. In this case it consists of 3 ODEs for the ventricular volume and the systemic and venous pressures.

_Note: this reduces and optimises the ODE system. It is, therefore, not always obvious, which states it will use and which it will drop. We can use the `states` and `observed` function to check this. It is recommended to do this, since small changes can reorder states, observables, and parameters._

States in the system are now:

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
states(circ_sys)
````

Observed variables - the system will drop these from the ODE system that is solved, but it keeps all the algebraic equations needed to calculate them in the system object, as well as the `ODEProblem` and solution object - are:

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
observed(circ_sys)
````

And the parameters (these could be reordered, so check these, too):

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
parameters(circ_sys)
````

### Define the ODE problem

First defined initial conditions `u0` and the time span for simulation:

_Note: the initial conditions are defined as a parameter map, rather than a vector, since the parameter map allows for changes in order.
This map can include non-existant states (like `LV.p` in this case), which allows for exchanging the compliances or the ventricle
for one that's defined in terms of $dp/dt$)._

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
u0 = [
        LV.p => MCFP
        LV.V => MCFP/Eₘᵢₙ
        Csa.p => MCFP
        Csa.V => MCFP*C_sa
        Csv.p => MCFP
        Csv.V => MCFP*C_sv
        ]
````

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
tspan = (0, 20)
````

in this case we use the mean cardiac filling pressure as initial condition, and simulate 20 seconds.

Then we can define the problem:

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
prob = ODEProblem(circ_sys, u0, tspan)
````

## Simulate

The ODE problem is now in the MTK/DifferentialEquations.jl format and we can use any DifferentialEquations.jl solver to solve it:

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
sol = solve(prob, Vern7(), reltol=1e-12, abstol=1e-12);
nothing #hide
````

## Results

````@example BjordalsbakkeModel
p1 = plot(sol, idxs=[LV.p,  Csa.in.p], tspan=(16 * τ, 17 * τ), xlabel = "Time [s]", ylabel = "Pressure [mmHg]",  hidexaxis = nothing) # Make a line plot
p2 = plot(sol, idxs=[LV.V], tspan=(16 * τ, 17 * τ),xlabel = "Time [s]", ylabel = "Volume [ml]",  linkaxes = :all)
p3 = plot(sol, idxs=[Csa.in.q,Csv.in.q], tspan=(16 * τ, 17 * τ),xlabel = "Time [s]", ylabel = "Flow rate [ml/s]", linkaxes = :all)
p4 = plot(sol, idxs=(LV.V, LV.p), tspan=(16 * τ, 17 * τ),xlabel = "Volume [ml]", ylabel = "Pressure [mmHg]", linkaxes = :all)

img = plot(p1, p2, p3, p4; layout=@layout([a b; c d]), legend = true)
